title: Four Years, Three Apartments
---

I've told this story a thousand times so I figure it's time to write it down.

Four years ago this week, Krista and I packed our two bedroom house in Little Rock into a Penske, sold our cars, said goodbye to friends and family and set out for New York. There were no jobs or apartment waiting for us. Just two gracious friends who offered a couch in their Sunset Park one bedroom.

Miraculously, the morning after we crossed the Verrazzano into Brooklyn we were signing a lease for the first apartment we saw. No proof of income, just goodwill, smiles and provision. The next morning I interviewed for a job I ended up taking and we unloaded the truck in the afternoon.

We loved that first one bedroom apartment on Carroll Street. It was just right. More than one night we crammed in 16 friends for dinner and drinks. The cozy murmur coming from the backyard of the bar, [High Dive](https://foursquare.com/v/high-dive-brooklyn-ny/4a07bae4f964a52096731fe3 "High Dive"), out the window in the summer and the garlicy smells of red sauce wafting in from [Aunt Suzie's](https://foursquare.com/v/aunt-suzies/44f46dedf964a52031381fe3 "Aunt Suzie's") in the fall are some of my fondest memories of that place. It was home base for most of our city firsts and we'll always have a special place in our heart for 640 Carroll.

In the meantime we began attending church at a place called [Trinity Grace](http://tgcparkslope.com/ "Trinity Grace Park Slope"). I cannot begin to describe the depths of the impact this group of people seeking God has had on Krista and me. Let's just say, they're the reason we decided early on that we would be Brooklyn lifers.

About two and a half years in, Krista and I started the ball rolling with the adoption we had been planning since we were married. The first thing we found out was that New York City adoption laws require families to have a room with a door for the child (or children) they are fostering to adopt. The one bedroom would no longer suffice.

One day during Christmas break, Krista and I casually set out to find a new apartment, fearing that we wouldn't be able to afford a two bedroom in the neighborhood that we loved. Perhaps unbelievably, we saw two that were nearby. On the way home from the second place we ran into an acquaintance from our street. She spun around in her tracks and said, "you guys still looking for an apartment?" Turns out the two bedroom in her family's building had just emptied. It seemed we were in the right place at the right time. Best part? It was two hundred yards down the street from the aforementioned first apartment.

Fast forward a year and a half and our two sweet little girls were just about to join us at home. Long story short, we had to move out of that second apartment abruptly. The move coincided with a previously scheduled trip to Texas, so we wouldn't have time to move our stuff. Remember that group of folks at church I mentioned earlier? They moved everything while we were gone, cleaning, painting and setting up our coziest home to date.

Three months later, our family of four is happy at home (3). We're hoping that this new place grows old with us. It's perfect. There's lots of light, a good cross breeze, a big room for the girls and private access to a roof out the window. I couldn't be happier.
